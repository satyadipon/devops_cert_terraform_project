To provision an EC2 instance using Terraform and set up Jenkins with Java and Python, you can follow these steps:

Step 1: Set up Terraform
1. Install Terraform on your machine by following the instructions provided in the official Terraform documentation (https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli).
2. Configure AWS credentials by either setting environment variables (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`) or using the AWS CLI (`aws configure`).

Step 2: Create Terraform Configuration
1. Create a new directory for your Terraform project.
2. Inside the project directory, create a new file called `main.tf` and add the following content:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"  # Update with your desired region
  access_key 	= "your_aws_access_key"
  secret_key 	= "your_aws_secret_key"
}

resource "aws_instance" "jenkins" {
  ami           = "ami-xxxxxxxx"  # Replace with the desired AMI ID
  instance_type = "t2.micro"  # Update with your desired instance type
  availability_zone		= "ap-south-1a" # Replace with the desired region
  key_name				= "jen-key" # Replace with your aws key-pair value
  vpc_security_group_ids	= [aws_security_group.sd_grp.id] # Replace with your desired security group name

  #the below provosioner block is to step by step installation of JAVA, PYTHON AND JENKINS
  provisioner "remote-exec" {
	inline = [
		"sudo yum update â€“y",
		"sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo",
		"sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key",
		"sudo yum upgrade",
		"sudo dnf install java-11-amazon-corretto -y",
		"sudo dnf install python3 -y",
		"sudo yum install jenkins -y",
		"sudo systemctl enable jenkins",
		"sudo systemctl start jenkins"
		]
}

  tags = {
    Name = "Jenkins-Java-Python-Server"
  }
}
```

Make sure to replace the `ami` value with the AMI ID of your desired Amazon Linux AMI.

Step 3: Initialize and Apply Terraform Configuration
1. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory.
2. Run the following command to initialize the Terraform project:

```bash
terraform init
```

3. Run the following command to create the EC2 instance:

```bash
terraform apply
```

You will be prompted to confirm the creation of resources. Type "yes" and press Enter to proceed.

Step 4: Access Jenkins Web UI
1. Get the public IP address of your EC2 instance from the AWS Management Console or by using the `terraform output` command.
2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>:8080`. Replace `<EC2_INSTANCE_PUBLIC_IP>` with the actual IP address.
3. Follow the instructions to unlock Jenkins. You can find the initial admin password in the EC2 instance by running:

```bash
sudo cat /var/lib/jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
```

4. Install recommended plugins and set up an admin user.

That's it! You now have a Jenkins instance provisioned using Terraform on an EC2 instance with Java and Python installed.

Remember to clean up resources after you're done by running:

```bash
terraform destroy
```
